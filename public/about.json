    "bio": "I am a creatively driven, solutions-minded full-stack software engineer with a passion for intuitive design and function.\n\nAs a Marine Corps veteran, my previous military experience informs everything that I do: from my ability to adapt and adjust plans quickly to finding efficient, concise solutions for challenging problems.\n\nIn 2023, I made my first steps as a programmer when I attended and graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive cohort. There, I learned Javascript, Python, HTML and CSS, and developed my skills with Express, Node, MongoDB, React, Django, and PostgreSQL."
